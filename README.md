# InternetAndWebSystem1-Class-Activity

For this activity, I started off with my groups implementation of the project which is the header/navbar, and the cards with a favourite button and a reserve button, and we decided to work seperately due to location, and timing. 

By the end of the sprint I had added a simple  pop-up that shows up on pressing a show location button, that shows off the location of where each on is located, and closes when pressing x. Through working on it for 2 hours. 

For outside resources and ideas I consulted AI for styling, afterwards, as it looked plain during testing (for the pop-up). Also not sure to add this, but Idea came from Simeon Nortey my group member for project 2.
